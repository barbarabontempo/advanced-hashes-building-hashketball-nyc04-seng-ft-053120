There is one method in this lab to implement: `game_hash`. This method contains and
returns a hash nested in the following manner:

* The top level of the hash has two keys: `:home`, for the home team, and
  `:away`, for the away team.
* The values of the `:home` and `:away` keys are hashes. These hashes have the
  following keys:
  * `:team_name`
  * `:colors`
  * `:players`
* The `:team_name` key points to a string of the team name.
* The `:colors` key points to an array of strings that are that team's colors.
* The `:players` key points to an `Array` of `Hash`es. Each `Hash` in the `Array`
  should contain the players' stats. Each stat should be a key that points to
  a value for that stat. The keys should be:
  * `:player_name`
  * `:number`
  * `:shoe`
  * `:points`
  * `:rebounds`
  * `:assists`
  * `:steals`
  * `:blocks`
  * `:slam_dunks`
* The data for each player is provided in a table below.
